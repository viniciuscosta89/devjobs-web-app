## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Be able to filter jobs on the index page by title, location, and whether a job is for a full-time position
- Be able to click a job from the index page so that they can read more information and apply for the job
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

### What I learned

It was a way to fix Vue 3 and its world in my mind. To get used to Vue 3 features, Pinia, Vue router. And I learned Tailwind because it's my first project with it.

### Continued development

It could improve Vue's folder and file architecture and best practices.
Insert unit and end-to-end tests with Vitest and Playwright.

### Useful resources

I recommend to read each technology documentation.
